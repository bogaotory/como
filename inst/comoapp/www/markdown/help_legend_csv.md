Data with simulation results is provided in .csv format with the variables in the table below.


`*_`: either for baseline or hypothetical scenario.
Each variable ends with `_min`, `_med` or `_max`. If there is only one model run (no generated uncertainty), these values are identical. Otherwise these are the lower limit, median and upper limit for the model credible interval, as per the "Generate Uncertainty" section.
